### CASCADES.md

The complete simplification cascades analysis from 2025-11-22.

**Status:**
- ✅ CASCADE #1: Configuration Duplication - Implemented
- ✅ CASCADE #2: Backmatter Rendering Duplication - Implemented
- ✅ CASCADE #3: Import Chain Proliferation - Implemented
- ✅ CASCADE #4: Type Normalization Boilerplate - Implemented
- ⏸️ CASCADE #5: State Management Sprawl - Deferred (most invasive, benefits not justified)
- ⏸️ CASCADE #6: Vertical Spacing Inconsistency - Deferred (can be done incrementally)

**Smaller Opportunities:**
- All smaller optimization opportunities documented as inline comments in source code
- See CASCADES.md sections A-C for details

### designs/

Completed design documents that have been implemented:

- `configuration-single-source.md` - Single source of truth for configuration
- `backmatter-rendering-unification.md` - Unified backmatter rendering
- `import-chain-simplification.md` - Simplified import dependencies
- `type-normalization.md` - Canonical type normalization utilities

See `../plans/completed/` for the implementation plans of these designs.

## Archive Policy

Documents are archived when:
1. The work is fully implemented and merged
2. No further active development is planned
3. The design/analysis is complete and serves as historical reference

Archived documents remain valuable for:
- Understanding design decisions
- Historical context for future refactoring
- Examples of the simplification cascade methodology
